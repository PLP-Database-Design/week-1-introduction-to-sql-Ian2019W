## **Assignment Questions**

1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
   Hardware: Physical components like servers and storage devices.
Software: DBMS software for managing data.
Data: The actual information stored in the database.
Procedures: Rules for accessing and modifying data.
Database Access Language: Language for interacting with the database (e.g., SQL).

3. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
A relational database organizes data into tables with rows and columns. Relationships are established between tables using primary and foreign keys.   

Examples:

E-commerce database   
Library database
School database
Hospital database


4. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
Data Definition Language (DDL): Defines the structure of a database, including creating, modifying, and deleting tables and their schemas.
Data Manipulation Language (DML): Manipulates data within a database, including inserting, updating, and deleting records.
Data Query Language (DQL): Retrieves specific data from a database using queries.
5. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
Primary Key:

Uniquely identifies each record in a table.   
Cannot contain null values.   
Must be unique within the table.   
Foreign Key:

References the primary key of another table.   
Establishes relationships between tables.

   
Can contain null values.   

6. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
An Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram is a graphical representation of entities (tables) and their relationships in a database. It helps visualize the database structure and design.
8. What are the advantages of relational databases?
Data Integrity: Ensures data consistency and accuracy.
Data Security: Provides mechanisms to protect data from unauthorized access.
Data Independence: Separates data from the applications that use it.
Data Sharing: Allows multiple users to access and share data.
Data Standardization: Enforces data standards and consistency.
9. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
   Integer: Stores whole numbers (e.g., 1, 10, -5)
Float/Decimal: Stores real numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.14, 12.5)
String/Text: Stores textual data (e.g., "Hello", "World")
Date/Time: Stores date and time values (e.g., "2023-11-22", "12:34:56")
10. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?  
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software used to manage and organize large amounts of data efficiently. It provides a structured way to store, retrieve, update, and delete data.   

Key purposes of a DBMS:

Data Storage: Stores data in a structured format, making it accessible and searchable.   
Data Retrieval: Allows users to retrieve specific data based on various criteria.   
Data Manipulation: Enables users to modify, update, and delete data.

   
Data Security: Protects data from unauthorized access and corruption.   
Data Integrity: Ensures data accuracy and consistency.   
Data Sharing: Facilitates data sharing among multiple users and applications.
Data Backup and Recovery: Provides mechanisms for backing up and restoring data in case of failures.
